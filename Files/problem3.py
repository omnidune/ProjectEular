# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

#################################################
# So ... largest factor of a number is around half of that number.
# Time is of essence in this problem, for very large numbers brute 
# force methods work fine, but take too long to compute. So, to mitigate 
# this if we start dividing the given number with 2,3,4â€¦ then we can run
# a test on each of those results for them being prime numbers, the first 
# one to clear the isprime function gets to be the largest prime number 
# which is a factor of the given number.
